<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>IN WHICH BILLY MEETS NIMBUS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">MOTHER had been helping Billy with his geography
lesson, sitting in the garden on a lovely day
early in spring, and showing Billy how the earth
revolves on its axis. To illustrate this difficult matter and
to make it interesting, she had taken a big yellow orange to
represent the Earth and had used a stick of lemon candy
for the Pole. She made the Equator out of a black rubber
band such as you put around fat envelopes.</p>

<p>Then, when Billy said that he understood, Mother dug
a hole in the orange and stuck the lemon stick in it and,
handing it to Billy, said with a droll twinkle in her blue
eyes, which always seemed to be laughing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to eat up the Earth through the
North Pole?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Billy had never before tasted the joys of an orange
eaten through a stick of lemon candy; so when Mother,
who had a trick of remembering nice things from her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
childhood, showed Billy how it was done, he settled down
to a blissful half hour in which he meant to devour the
whole earth.</p>

<p>It tasted so good that he rolled over on the short grass,
under a lilac-bush in full bloom, and only took his lips from
the North Pole long enough to tell his mother that it tasted
&#8220;bully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his mother, standing up and shaking out
her blue dress, &#8220;I must go now. Here is your geography.
Don&#8217;t forget to bring it in when you come, and don&#8217;t lose
the Equator off the Earth, even if you are eating it. I
don&#8217;t know what would become of us if the Equator really
should get away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy laughed aloud. It really was no trouble at all to
understand things when Mother made them appear so
funny.</p>

<p>He lay on his back looking up into the sky, which was
just the color of his mother&#8217;s blue dress. White clouds,
like mountains of white feathers which must be very soft
to sleep on, were over his head.</p>

<p>A bee was buzzing lazily over the lavender blossoms of
the lilacs. A soft wind was blowing. It was indeed very
pleasant.</p>

<p>What if the bee should turn into a fairy!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Billy aloud.</p>

<p>The bee, being puzzled, scratched his head with his left
hindfoot and answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you be one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am one bee!&#8221; answered the bee, striking a match on
Billy&#8217;s orange and lighting a grapevine cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you be a fairy?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always beeing things&mdash;flowers and honey&mdash;so
of course I could bee a fairy. How do you know that I
am not one? Look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy sat up and looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; exclaimed Billy. &#8220;A minute ago I
thought you were a bee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can bee anything I choose,&#8221; said the Fairy. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why you thought I was a bee. Because I can bee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you now?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the Geography Fairy,&#8221; answered the stranger.</p>

<p>He held out his hand and then looked at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not raining yet,&#8221; he observed; &#8220;still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Without finishing his sentence he unfolded a pink parasol
and tossed it into the air. It sailed away, slowly at
first, then more rapidly as the light wind caught it and
carried it out of sight beyond the lilac-bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t need it till it begins to rain,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;so they might as well have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; gasped Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sunbeams. If a sunbeam gets wet he&#8217;s done for.
Haven&#8217;t you ever noticed that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought he had noticed something of the kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Anyway the sunbeams all disappeared directly it began to
rain. But being just an ordinary little boy, he was much
more interested in the conversation of the wonderful
stranger than he was in sunbeams, and that is why he
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Nimbus and I live in the clouds with
the other fairies. I was named after one of the
clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected Billy, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in fairies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Nimbus briskly, &#8220;keep right on don&#8217;t
believing. It doesn&#8217;t disturb me in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And besides,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;there couldn&#8217;t be such a
thing as a Geography Fairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; demanded Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I have never seen one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; returned Nimbus. &#8220;Did you ever see a
noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Billy admitted, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I ever did. At
least I don&#8217;t remember ever having seen one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do you believe that there <i>aren&#8217;t</i> any noises?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had no reply that seemed suitable, and so he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Apparently not caring whether he got an answer or not,
Nimbus leaped lightly from the lilac blossom and, picking
up an irregular sunbeam that filtered through the bush,
he set it carefully on edge against the brim of Billy&#8217;s hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;We&#8217;ll take this sunbeam with us&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8220;They get tired lying flat on their backs so much,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take this one with us when we go. When
we&#8217;re hungry we&#8217;ll eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not going anywhere,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;At
least <i>I</i> am not. I&#8217;ve got to go into the house and put the
toys away in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the proverb say
&#8216;Never do anything to-day you can just as well put off
until to-morrow&#8217;? Let&#8217;s enchant a trolley car and go look
after the Equator. I ought to be there now. That&#8217;s my job,
looking after the Equator. I&#8217;ve left the Equine Ox there,
but he has such a habit of getting indigestion in one of
his four stomachs, and sometimes in all of them, that he
is very inattentive to business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indigestion in four stomachs must be terribly distressing,&#8221;
said Billy. &#8220;But what is an Equine Ox?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely see one twice a year,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;But
they are always around. They have to be somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they do,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;but what are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their names are Vernal and Autumnal. Here&#8217;s a
poem I wrote about them once. My friends say I am conceited
about my poetry, but I&#8217;m not. I don&#8217;t think it is
as good as it really is.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;I never had an Equine Ox</div>
<div class="indent">To glad me with its soft brown eye,</div>
<div class="verse">But when I stroked its brindled locks</div>
<div class="indent">It always rudely asked me why.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<div class="first">&#8220;I never whispered fondly in</div>
<div class="indent">The creature&#8217;s smooth and velvet ear,</div>
<div class="verse">That it did not absurdly grin</div>
<div class="indent">And shed a cadent, mirthful tear.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;I never clasped its crumpled horn,</div>
<div class="indent">Nor gazed on it with loving look,</div>
<div class="verse">That it did not give moos of scorn</div>
<div class="indent">And sometimes even try to hook.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;So, though I love the Equine Ox,</div>
<div class="indent">I must admit that, on the whole,</div>
<div class="verse">His conduct very often shocks</div>
<div class="indent">My trusting and confiding soul.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;will give you an excellent idea
of the Equine Ox. Now let us enchant that trolley car
and be off about our business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;you can&#8217;t enchant a trolley car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;never believing in
things. Bring me a trolley car and I&#8217;ll show you whether
or not I can enchant it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> can&#8217;t bring you a trolley car,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to hail one on the street if you want one. Anyway
they don&#8217;t go to the Equator; they only go to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see where they go,&#8221; returned Nimbus. &#8220;If I
were going alone I&#8217;d go on a cloud, but I don&#8217;t suppose
you could sit on a cloud, could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He regarded Billy doubtfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Besides, what&#8217;s the
need of going at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I really must go! A foolish Spring Tide broke
one of the tropics the other day, and if the other gets
broken there will be nothing to hold the Equator down
but the meridians, and you know they&#8217;re very fragile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy didn&#8217;t know that, but he nodded intelligently. It
is always best to pretend to know more about geography
than you really do.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be back in time for dinner,&#8221; continued Nimbus;
&#8220;that is, if I don&#8217;t have to fasten up the tides again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean to say you have to
fasten the tides?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; replied Nimbus. &#8220;You know the tides are
always trying to put out the Moon, and they go chasing
around the Earth after her night and day. Of course the
shore stops them after a while and drives them back, and
that&#8217;s what makes them high and low. They&#8217;re high when
they run up and try to wash over the shore, and low when
the shore drives them back again. But to keep them from
going too far we tie them down with meridians. That&#8217;s
why they call them tides. Each one is tied, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious!&#8221; exclaimed Billy. &#8220;I hope they can&#8217;t get
untied and put the Moon out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they won&#8217;t,&#8221; Nimbus assured him, &#8220;while I&#8217;m
watching them! Sometimes they sneak up on her out of
the ocean in little drops that we call mist, but the Sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
always catches them at it, and sends them scurrying down
in rain again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost believe I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;if you&#8217;re sure
we can be back in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of it,&#8221; said Nimbus; &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you back
on a meteor if I have to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy excused himself for a minute and ran into the
house to tell his mother, but she was nowhere to be found.
So he wrote a note in which he explained that he had gone
away for a little while with the Geography Fairy. Returning
to the garden, he found that Nimbus had now
grown to be as large as a middle-sized baby. He was
strolling across the lawn on his way to the front gate.</p>

<p>Billy trudged along by his side, and soon they were at
the street corner awaiting the coming of a big red trolley
car, which Billy hailed at Nimbus&#8217;s suggestion.</p>

<p>When the two got in the conductor looked at the queer
little stranger in amazement.</p>

<p>But Nimbus only nodded at him coldly, leaped up on
the seat and began digging into his pocket, from which
he presently pulled a huge blue transfer.</p>

<p>This he held out when the conductor came for the fare.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t no good,&#8221; said the conductor.</p>

<p>For reply Nimbus folded the transfer up into a tiny
wand, touched the conductor on the cap with it and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This car for the Equator. Passengers desiring transfers
for the Arctic Circle or the North Pole will kindly
mention it before we get to Cuba.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE ENCHANTED TROLLEY CAR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OF COURSE such an announcement as that made
a great commotion in the trolley car. The other
passengers, a thin deacon, two plumber&#8217;s apprentices
and a burglar, wanted to get off immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going back to the shop to get the tools,&#8221; said
one of the plumber&#8217;s apprentices.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on my way to a horse trade,&#8221; explained the
deacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the burglar, &#8220;was just looking about for
a nice easy house to rob. They don&#8217;t have any houses at
the Equator, so I would have absolutely nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; said the conductor peevishly. &#8220;Keep your
seats, gents. There ain&#8217;t no such a place as the Equator
on this line. You&#8217;re on the wrong car, young chaps,&#8221; he
added, turning to Billy and Nimbus.</p>

<p>Billy was troubled at this. Could it be that Nimbus
really couldn&#8217;t enchant the trolley car after all?</p>

<p>But the Fairy only smiled as the car, which had started
away suddenly, came to a stop, as if it had run into something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we wouldn&#8217;t get past it,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;Get past what?&#8221; inquired Billy and the plumber&#8217;s apprentices
in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;That imaginary line,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;I drew it across
the track.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;no imaginary line really goes anywhere
except the Equator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither will the trolley car until I let it,&#8221; replied
Nimbus. &#8220;So they are in the same fix.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman now came into the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not enough juice,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;She turns all right,
but she don&#8217;t get nowhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try her again,&#8221; advised the conductor anxiously. He
was looking at Nimbus and Billy with suspicion. &#8220;You
kids ain&#8217;t been soapin&#8217; the track, have you?&#8221; he inquired
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman again turned on the power, but although
the wheels hummed and whirred on the track, not an inch
forward did the car go.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something wrong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know
what it is. She turns all right, and she acts all right, but
she don&#8217;t go ahead none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;till these people get off. It
would be a shame to take them to the Equator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly it would,&#8221; said the deacon. &#8220;I for one am
going to get off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said the burglar.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;Both the plumber&#8217;s apprentices jumped hastily to the ground&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>And both of them did.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right with us,&#8221; said the plumber&#8217;s apprentices,
settling back in their seats. &#8220;Our time will go on just the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t with me,&#8221; said the motorman. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to see what&#8217;s stopping her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the rear door and was about to swing off the
steps when he uttered a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great rabbits!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;She&#8217;s risin&#8217; off&#8217;m the
track!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this both the plumber&#8217;s apprentices ran to the platform
and jumped hastily to the ground.</p>

<p>The motorman and conductor hurried to the front
platform, but when they reached it the car had risen
thirty feet in the air and was sailing merrily through
space.</p>

<p>The conductor reeled back into the car and sank breathless
on a seat. The motorman followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a way to do is this?&#8221; demanded the conductor
of Nimbus. &#8220;And me with a wife and five
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger at all,&#8221; said Nimbus soothingly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to come down again, you know. Everything
does, that goes up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conductor had got a little over his fright, and was
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re going, Tommy,&#8221; he said to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
motorman, &#8220;but it does look as if we was on our way,
don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage!&#8221; said the motorman, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve a good
mind to chuck this little feller overboard. It&#8217;s all his
doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nimbus paid no attention to him at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said to Billy, &#8220;that a trolley car can be
enchanted if you go at it right. I could enchant the conductor
and motorman if I wanted to. I think I&#8217;d turn the
motorman into a bull.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman grew pale at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t do nothing like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I like this
flying business, honest I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;but I think you had better
go out on the platform and look for stars. We may be
running into one any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman was glad to return to his post, and
the conductor arose and walked unsteadily to the
rear platform, where he held fast to the dashboard
rail and gazed with open-mouthed wonder at the scene
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be coming to the Dog Star,&#8221; Nimbus told
Billy. &#8220;His name is Sirius, but he isn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s almost
eight million years old, but he still behaves like a Puppy
Star at the snow-making season. He worries the Snow
Fairies half to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are Snow Fairies?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;They are the people that make the snow. Didn&#8217;t
you ever hear the proverb, &#8216;Make snow while the moon
shines&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy wasn&#8217;t quite sure. He had heard one very much
like that, though, about hay, and he wondered if they made
snow in fields and left it out to dry in the moonshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nimbus, although Billy had not spoken, &#8220;it
is very much the same. The snowflakes grow on the little
stalks that shoot up from the clouds, and the Snow Fairies
harvest them and dry them in the moonlight. Then they
sift it down on the land and sea, whenever Jack Frost
says the little boys and girls are tired of nutting and
making autumn-leaf bonfires, and want to coast and throw
snowballs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they make hail that way, too?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! gracious, no. They break the hail off the rain
clouds with their hammers, and it freezes on the way down.
They soon tire of that, though, so they never keep it up
long. That is why you hear people say &#8216;Hail and Farewell.&#8217;
You have to say good-by to a hailstorm almost
before you&#8217;ve had time to say hello to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is very ill-mannered of the Dog Star to worry
them,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dog Stars have no manners. That is very well
shown in the poem I wrote about the Dog Star. Did you
ever happen to hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I never did.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;as nearly as I can remember it
runs something like this:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; continued Nimbus, &#8220;the Dog Star cares
absolutely nothing for manners. He even barks at
O&#8217;Taurus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who,&#8221; inquired Billy, &#8220;is O&#8217;Taurus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the Irish Bull,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you more
about him later. I&#8217;ve got to go to meet this Meteor now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had noticed that for some time it had been getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
brighter and brighter, although the Sun had hidden himself
behind a great wall of blue-black clouds. Now he looked
through the front windows and saw a great star sweeping
rapidly down on them, swishing a long tail behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is it a comet?&#8221; he asked in affright, observing that
the motorman rushed into the car, slamming the door after
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comet nothing!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a fourth-
class Meteor with a message for me. They&#8217;re the A.D.T.
boys up here, and he&#8217;s probably brought some word from
the Equine Ox.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Meteor came alongside and Billy read in gold letters
across his glowing cap the words:</p>

<p class="center"><small>PLANETARY MESSENGER SERVICE</small><br />

No. 7,622,451</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;there are a lot of them, aren&#8217;t
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven million nine hundred thousand six hundred and
three,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;What have you got, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Message, sir,&#8221; said the Meteor briskly, taking off his
cap and extracting a blue envelope.</p>

<p>Nimbus took it and ran his eye over it hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a pretty kettle of fish,&#8221; he said, handing the
paper to Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>This is what Billy read as he held the paper in his
trembling fingers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Accidentally went to sleep and the Spring Tide broke the other
tropic. Equator trying to get away, and think I can&#8217;t hold him
long. Please come or send help as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Regretfully, <span class="smcap">Vernal E. Ox</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>So! The Equator was trying to do the very thing
Mother told Billy not to let him do! He was trying to
slip off the earth by way of the South Pole!</p>

<small>THE EQUATOR IS LOOSE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;BOTHER that Equine Ox,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;I might
have known he&#8217;d do something like that, and just
before procession week, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Procession week?&#8221; said Billy wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the week of the procession of the Equine Oxes.
The Sun and the Moon and their oldest daughter, the
Evening Star, were coming down to see it, and Jack Frost
and Aurora Borealis ought to be there now. And that
miserable Equine Ox has gone and spoiled it all. He isn&#8217;t
fit for anything but a barbecue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Billy, while the conductor
and the motorman gaped in a dazed silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? Why, fix it, of course. I only hope we can get
there before he breaks away altogether. It would be a
beautiful state of affairs to have an Equator charging up
and down the world, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be fun,&#8221; ventured Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;When you played under
the trees in your front yard, do you think it would be fun
to have cocoanuts drop on you instead of acorns? Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of rabbits and chipmunks in the woods, do you think it
would be fun to see lions and tigers and boa-constrictors
and laughing hyenas, to say nothing of hippopotamuses
with teeth like banisters? Yes, it would be real jolly now,
wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy saw that Nimbus was seriously disturbed and he
kept silent.</p>

<p>The Meteor, who had entered the car unasked and taken
a seat on the floor, now got up and began to shoot violently
from one door to another, sometimes zigzagging so that he
bumped the windows. His blazing tail trailed after him,
and once or twice Billy had to draw back quickly to keep
his face from a severe switching.</p>

<p>The conductor and the motorman were very much annoyed
by these antics, and at last the conductor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him, anyway? Why don&#8217;t he
sit still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t sit still,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;A meteor is a shooting
star and ever so often he has to shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shootin&#8217; is against the rules,&#8221; growled the motorman.
&#8220;No shootin&#8217; allowed in any cars of this company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t shooting aloud. He&#8217;s shooting to himself,&#8221;
said Nimbus. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send him back to the Equator as soon
as I compose a message that is strong enough to tell the
Equine Ox what I think of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had been looking out of the window. A long way
off he noticed a row of enormous signs, each with curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
characters on it, all outlined in bright green and blue
stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signs of the Zodiac,&#8221; said the Meteor, coming to a sudden
stop and looking over Billy&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;&#8216;Keep off
the sky,&#8217; and &#8216;No loose dogs allowed,&#8217; and such like. The
Aerolites have just turned &#8217;em on. They come right after
the twilight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I understand,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; said the Meteor, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll explain it in
a minute. I&#8217;ve got a few shots in me now that have got
to go off.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet and began to dart backward and
forward in the car till Nimbus, who was writing on a pad
of paper, became irritated and slammed the car-door on
the Meteor&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he peevish!&#8221; said the Meteor, sinking down at
Billy&#8217;s side. &#8220;But as I was saying about the Aerolites,
every night the Sun goes down, as you know, and it would
be pitch dark until the Moon and the Stars came up if it
wasn&#8217;t for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them keeps watch until he sees the Sun starting
to slide behind a mountain or into the sea, and then he
tells the others, and they all hurry around and light the
twilights. When they have them all lit there is enough
light to see by till the Moon and the Stars get out of bed
for the night. After that they can light the Signs of the
Zodiac. They get paid for that. Lighting the twilights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
they have to do for their board and lodging and motive
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus left off writing. &#8220;I think that will do,&#8221; he said,
handing the pad to Billy.</p>

<p>Billy read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;V. E. Ox, Equator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the good-for-nothing, idle, dull-witted, stupid, feather-brained
idiots I have met in twelve million years you are easily the
worst. Send that Spring Tide to bed for a week. Get the other
Equine Ox and a regiment of elephants and sit on the Equator
till I get there. If he tries to get away duck him in the ocean.
My only regret is that you have but four stomachs instead of
ninety-four to get indigestion in.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Yours disgustedly, <span class="smcap">Nimbus</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Meteor took the paper from Billy&#8217;s hand, Nimbus
released the tail from the door and he shot forth into the
night.</p>

<p>Billy began to be very much distressed about the darkness,
remembering his promise to his mother to be home
for dinner. Nimbus, noticing his troubled face and feeling
better now that he had unburdened himself of his opinion
of the Equine Ox, sat beside him and said cheerfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Billy, it&#8217;s always half dark up here.
We&#8217;re out of the air, you know, and we have to have air
to see the light through, just as your mother has to have
opera-glasses to see the play through. We&#8217;ll be home in
time for dinner. Never fear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>At this assurance Billy felt much better, and became
very eager to see the great fight that he knew would take
place when they got down to the Equator and took part in
the effort to keep him from escaping.</p>

<p>But the motorman and the conductor were in no such
cheerful mood. They sat apart in a corner and talked
in whispers; and Billy, listening although he did not mean
to, soon learned that they were talking about the Snow
Fairies.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them,&#8221; said the conductor, &#8220;that spills snow all
over the tracks and ties up the lines in winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it is!&#8221; said the motorman. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get off and fix
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy glanced out of the window. There, right before
his eyes, he saw a great number of little people, clad in
white uniforms, raking huge masses of what seemed to be
white flowers on the upper side of a cloud. Through the
dim half-light he watched them working away, with rakes
and pitchforks, some of them piling the white flakes into
great stacks, while others pulled long rows of them to the
edge of the cloud and pushed them over the side.</p>

<p>Billy remembered that it was summer when he left home
and he wondered how it happened that snow-making was
going on; but following with his eyes the flakes that whirled
downward he saw a long chain of mountains far below.
He knew, of course, that snow fell on mountains, even in
summer time, so he understood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;I tell you what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; the motorman was saying; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go out and back her sideways and we&#8217;ll run through &#8217;em.
That&#8217;ll knock &#8217;em all off the cloud, and we won&#8217;t have no
more snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great idea,&#8221; said the conductor. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get &#8217;em all at
one lick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked anxiously at Nimbus, who overheard, but
only chuckled. &#8220;Let &#8217;em try it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and see what
happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus joined Billy at the window, and the motorman
and the conductor, seeing that the Fairy&#8217;s back was turned,
got up very quietly and went out on the front platform.</p>

<p>The motorman put his lever on the controller and, looking
around carefully to make sure that he was not observed,
reversed the power.</p>

<p>The car trembled, stopped, then began to go backward
with a sidelong motion that took it right into the snow
cloud.</p>

<p>Instantly the air grew cold, and the wind howled around
the trolley pole and rattled the windows.</p>

<p>Straight into a great pile of snow went the car, and the
Snow Fairies, looking up, saw it coming and skipped away
in every direction.</p>

<p>There was a shock, snow flew in showers, then the car
buried itself in a great white pile up to the window tops
and stopped stock still.</p>

<p>Stamping and pawing the snow out of their eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mouths, the motorman and conductor came back into the
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasant weather, gentlemen,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Looks
a little like snow, however. Suppose you go out now and
clear the track. You&#8217;re used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angry, but too much ashamed of themselves to show
their feelings, the motorman and the conductor got shovels
from under the seats and went out to clear away a path
for the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;It always pays best to let Nature take care of herself,
as the boy said who sat on the volcano,&#8221; Nimbus observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a dreadful delay, though, and we are in such
a hurry to get to the Equator,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, there will be no delay at all! The Cloud is
going right in our direction just as fast as we were. We&#8217;ll
warm up, however, for it&#8217;s a trifle cold,&#8221; said Nimbus. And
taking out the sunbeam he had brought with him from
the lilac bush, he hit a piece out of it and handed it to
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nothing so stimulating in cold
weather as a sunbeam. We&#8217;ll just sit here and wait for
an answer to my telegram. And you can act acquainted
with the sky people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked out of the window into the sky. Was it
true, he wondered, that the Sun and Moon were really
sky people?</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Nimbus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;I was just wondering if the Stars are all really people,&#8221;
said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really people!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Well I should say they
are. And all the Clouds are, too. You see that bunch over
there? Well, that is Mrs. Pink-Cloud and Mrs. White-Cloud
and Mrs. Pearl-Cloud and Mrs. Mackerel-Cloud
and Mrs. Yellow-Cloud sitting together and sewing on
party dresses for their children to go to the Star children&#8217;s
birthday party. It&#8217;s warm over there where they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Are they all named?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Named! Of course they are! And every Star, too.
But nobody can remember them but their own mother,
Mrs. Moon. Even their father, Mr. Sun, gets confused
sometimes and mixes the boys&#8217; names with the girls&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the Clouds people, too?&#8221; asked Billy wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as much people as you are,&#8221; answered Nimbus
seriously. &#8220;Old General Gray-Cloud and old General
Thunder-Cloud are great fighters and have awful battles.
You can hear them down on the Earth sometimes. It
sounds like thunder and looks like lightning from where
you live, but from where we live&mdash;Oh, my!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;how very interesting! And do
the mothers teach their children to behave the way our
mothers do on the Earth, or are they allowed to do as they
please in the sky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you do show your ignorance!&#8221; said Nimbus, with
such severity that Billy quite blushed for himself. &#8220;Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
let me tell you what I saw only yesterday when I was under
the lilac bush waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know about me before I saw you?&#8221; asked
Billy, much flattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly I did. I saw you having such a stupid
time with a geography lesson which I knew I could make
so easy for you that I said to myself: &#8216;I&#8217;ll just
wait until I have him all to myself and then I&#8217;ll show
him!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very kind of you,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;and I am
sure that I shall never forget anything I have seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way with me,&#8221; said Nimbus; &#8220;so what
I saw of the Cloud children I will tell to you, and then
it will be just the same as if you had seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it will,&#8221; said Billy, who by this time had got to have
great faith in the Geography Fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose makes it rain?&#8221; asked Nimbus
suddenly.</p>

<p>Billy thought intently for a moment. He knew he had
heard something about clouds and mist and heat and cold,
but for the life of him he couldn&#8217;t remember when anybody
asked him. That is what makes examinations so
hard. You know, but you can&#8217;t remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;You can&#8217;t think, can you?
Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, and you&#8217;ll never forget this reason. The
other day, when their mothers were all sitting and sewing,
the Cloud children&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;What are their names?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there happened to be Pinkie Pink-Cloud and
Goldie Gold-Cloud and Pearlie Pearl-Cloud. They asked
their mothers if they could float over Central Park and
watch the Earth children at play. Their mothers said yes,
so away they went. At first it was great fun to watch, for
it was Mayday and all the children were marching about in
their pretty white dresses while nursemaids and fräuleins
and mademoiselles by the dozen, and a few mothers, were
looking on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Pinkie and Goldie and Pearlie began to play tag
among themselves, nor was it very long before Pinkie said
that Goldie did not tag her when she said she did, and
Pearlie took sides; so in one moment those little sunny
faces grew black with anger and presently they began to
cry as hard as ever they could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Billy, as Nimbus paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; repeated the Fairy, &#8220;don&#8217;t you see? Their tears
were rain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next thing that happened was that their mothers
looked up from their sewing and saw the dark spot over the
park, where, a few minutes ago, it had all been bright and
sunny. They knew what had happened, for in April and
May the Cloud children are easily upset and cry if you
poke your finger at them. So they floated over to the park
and, instead of asking the children what the matter was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as most mothers would have done, Mrs. Gold-Cloud told
the children to look down at the park.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did they see?&#8221; asked Billy, who never before
had thought of looking at the Earth children through the
eyes of the clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the rain spoiling all the pretty white dresses and
the children all stopping their play and rushing about for
shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I was there myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you?&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Then you know what
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know it stopped raining,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you know why?&#8221; asked Nimbus.</p>

<p>Billy shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Mrs. Gold-Cloud told the children how tears
and black looks on their faces always spoiled the pleasure of
somebody else, and how smiles and sweet looks and lots of
love in the heart brings happiness. When she said this, the
Cloud children dried their tears on their mothers&#8217; cloud
handkerchiefs and began to smile, and when Pinkie and
Goldie kissed each other, the whole sky brightened up. So
everything got sunshiny again, and of course the rain
stopped as soon as the tears were dried, so in five minutes
the little Earth children were running about again as
happy as lambs. And the sight of their happiness made
the Cloud children glad they had not been so selfish as to
quarrel long.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;They must be nice children,&#8221; said Billy thoughtfully.
&#8220;That story sounds the way my mother tells things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you go back, you can tell the story to her,&#8221; said
Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for telling me,&#8221; said Billy politely. &#8220;It is a
very nice story and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t forget it. I&#8217;ll have lots of
things to tell when I get back. What are you going to do
about the Equator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; The last exclamation was directed at the
Meteor, who suddenly appeared through the snow bank
and, panting for breath, handed Nimbus a message which
Billy read over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The message read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Glad to know you are coming, and thanks for your kind words.
Equator is loose.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Respectfully, <span class="smcap">Equine Ox</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE EQUINE OX AND THE EVENING STAR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; EXPECTED it,&#8221; said Nimbus with a sigh. &#8220;I
might have known the Equine Ox couldn&#8217;t hold him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose it is any use to go to the Equator
now, is it?&#8221; asked Billy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we can go there
if we don&#8217;t know where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we know where it was, and there&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll
go,&#8221; snapped Nimbus. &#8220;I have a little speech to make to
the Equine Ox that he ought to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman and the conductor had now got a nice,
clean path shoveled through the snow, so they boarded the
car and it soon slid off the snow cloud and sped on again.</p>

<p>Presently Billy, looking downward, saw that they were
coming closer to the Earth all the time. And what a different
Earth it was from any he had ever seen outside of a
geography! A curving coast-line laced with filmy surf lay
below him, and on the hills that rose from it he could see
countless palm trees, each with a little tuft at the top like
the long blades of blue grass about the edge of the garden
at home, well beyond the reach of the lawn mower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious! We must be near where the Equator was,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
he exclaimed. &#8220;It looks like a conservatory outdoors down
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;It&#8217;s the grandstand. That&#8217;s
where the procession of the Equine Oxen was to be held.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it won&#8217;t be held now?&#8221; timidly suggested
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will, if I have anything to do with it. Just because
we never did have a procession without an Equator is no
reason we shouldn&#8217;t have one. Besides, now that there&#8217;s
no Equator to watch, unless they parade, those good-for-nothing
creatures won&#8217;t earn their cuds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car by this time was grating on a hillside, and soon
brought up between a couple of slender palm trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been expecting you,&#8221; said a voice&mdash;a sad voice that
seemed to come from directly above the car.</p>

<p>Looking out of the car window, Billy saw a bright light
among the branches of the tree&mdash;a light that surrounded
like a halo the figure of a very pretty girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Nimbus briskly, lifting his hat, &#8220;it&#8217;s the
Evening Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Evening Star, &#8220;it is I. I came to complain
about the Equine Ox. He&#8217;s very disconsolate, and
he&#8217;s singing continually. I wish you&#8217;d stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was very much surprised to find the Evening Star
all alone. He was about to ask Nimbus why it was when
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Papa&mdash;he&#8217;s the Sun&mdash;never comes out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
night; and Mrs. Moon, who&#8217;s my mamma, isn&#8217;t up yet, so
I had to come alone. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to
know, little boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was very much abashed at thus having a question
answered before he had asked it, and especially by a young
lady whom he had never met. But there was one thing he
wanted to know very much, so he said politely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. I should like to know why the Equine
Ox sings when he is unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so people can tell he&#8217;s the Equine OX,&#8221; said
the Evening Star. &#8220;He always does things backward.
When he&#8217;s very angry he rolls on the ground and roars
with laughter. When he&#8217;s pleased about anything he
weeps bitterly, and when he&#8217;s unhappy he sings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is now,&#8221; said Nimbus, who had been listening
intently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy heard something that first sounded like a long-drawn-out
moo, but which he soon recognized as a very
familiar air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Us, too?&#8221; inquired the motorman and conductor. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want to be left alone in these here foreign parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;come ahead!&#8221; and he led the way
down a winding pathway that opened through the
trees.</p>

<p>The singing grew louder and louder as they proceeded,
and shortly they came out into a little open space overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with flowers and surrounded by a very dense tropical
growth. In the center of it stood a creature that looked
a little like an ox, a little like a horse, and very much like
a map of the solar system. Billy and the street-car men
stopped at a signal from Nimbus. The Equine OX was
singing.</p>

<p>Directly the song was finished Nimbus strode up to
the Equine Ox and, shaking his fist angrily at him, demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir, where is that Equator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the question,&#8221; said the Equine Ox; &#8220;where is he?
Who knows the answer?&#8221; Then seeing Billy, he added:
&#8220;Maybe you do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, sir,&#8221; replied Billy in confusion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t.
Not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay no attention to him,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;He&#8217;s merely
trying to avert suspicion from himself.&#8221; Then turning to
the Equine Ox, he proceeded: &#8220;Tell us how he got away.
Be quick, there is no time to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there is,&#8221; said the Equine Ox; &#8220;any quantity
of it! I lose a great deal every day and hope to lose a
great deal more. As for finding time, now that is
another&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did the Equator get away?&#8221; said Nimbus sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, it was this way. Night fell on the tropics
and the tropics broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; exclaimed the conductor. &#8220;That&#8217;s a joke.
Ho, ho!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;What is the gentleman angry about?&#8221; uneasily asked
the Equine Ox, who always laughed when he was angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Nimbus; &#8220;go ahead with your explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a few waves broke,&#8221; continued the Equine Ox,
&#8220;and then day broke and, well&mdash;what could the Equator
do but break, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you sit on it?&#8221; asked Billy eagerly.</p>

<p>The Equine Ox regarded him gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever sit on an Equator?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Billy, embarrassed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said the Equine Ox. &#8220;Far be it from
me to sit on an Equator when it is going anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s completely gone, has it?&#8221; asked Nimbus.
&#8220;Which way did it go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I answer both of those questions first?&#8221; said the
Equine Ox.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer the last,&#8221; volunteered the Evening Star.
&#8220;It went south and slipped off the South Pole. I
saw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus fell back with a groan and Billy ran forward to
catch him.</p>

<p>The motorman and conductor gathered around. &#8220;Jab
him in the ribs with the crank handle,&#8221; suggested the conductor.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the way we do when they faints on the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nimbus revived before this became necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;It gave me such a start,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;The Equator&#8217;s got a better one,&#8221; said the Equine Ox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s easy once you get a start,&#8221; commented
the motorman.</p>

<p>Nimbus was now himself, and a very energetic little self
he was. First he placed the conductor and the motorman
in charge of the Equine Ox, with orders not to let him
out of their sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be here to-morrow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or the procession
cannot go on, and if the procession does not go on
it will always be summer and the sea will dry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motorman and the conductor were scarcely eager
to undertake the charge, but something in Nimbus&#8217;s manner
convinced them that it was necessary, so they consented.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Nimbus to the Evening Star, &#8220;will please
go and tell your father that the Equator is off the Earth
and that I will try to catch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; he said to Billy, &#8220;come with me. As soon
as the Equator is off the Earth, he will shrink up to the
size of a barrel hoop, and the meanness in his disposition
condensed into that small space will make a perfect fiend
of him. He is liable to drop right down on us this very
minute and burn us into a cinder before you can say &#8216;Jack
Robinson.&#8217; He gets so hot when he&#8217;s angry that he has
been known to set an iceberg on fire. By the way,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;how quickly can you say &#8216;Jack Robinson&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackrobinson!&#8221; said Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;I thought so!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;You&#8217;d have been dry
ashes before you got to a-c-k.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had he left off speaking when a Meteor dashed
in with a message from the Dog Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Equator coming back to Earth vowing vengeance
against Nimbus and Evening Star,&#8221; it said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>IN PURSUIT</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;FIRST of all,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;we must find the Rays.
Then we&#8217;ll go down to the Meteor farm and put
all the Meteors who are off watch or on part time,
to work doing scout duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the Rays?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the Sun&#8217;s private messengers. They do all his
regular work for him, such as making things grow, and
arranging the weather, and building the bridges&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bridges?&#8221; Billy inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, rainbow bridges. How could we fairies get over
the ocean if it wasn&#8217;t for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might go on enchanted trolley cars,&#8221; suggested
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we might, if trolley cars grew on trees in jungles
like monkeys, but they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought it best to make no more suggestions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rays,&#8221; continued Nimbus, &#8220;are named Violet, Indigo,
Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Get them
all together and they make a beautiful, clear, white light,
and we&#8217;ll need such a light to find the Equator.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>There was a rustling of the trees behind them and a sad
voice called out: &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d take me with you. I&#8217;m
afraid to stay alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked quickly around and saw the Evening Star
standing at a little distance, looking very pretty indeed
in the soft light that seemed to sift out of her white
frock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense!&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;We&#8217;ve men&#8217;s work here.
You don&#8217;t want to go anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two bright tears stood in the Evening Star&#8217;s eyes and
glistened in the glow that surrounded her. Nimbus
clapped his hands in delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, you fellows!&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;come out of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; cried Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rays&mdash;all of them. Don&#8217;t you see them hiding in
those teardrops? Come, come. No more delay! I&#8217;ve important
work for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, there suddenly appeared before him seven
lively little chaps, each clad from head to foot in his own
prismatic color, and all dancing excitedly about the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go tell the old man that the Equator has got away,&#8221;
commanded Nimbus. &#8220;And then come back here and
make us a searchlight. If he isn&#8217;t back here where he
belongs by to-morrow there&#8217;s no telling what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the Rays suddenly united in a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
shaft of white light and whisked away over the treetops.</p>

<p>As they vanished Billy thought he heard a sob, and
glancing about, saw the Evening Star sitting in the
branches of a low palm and crying as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m afraid! I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;If the
Equator should come back and find me here when you&#8217;re
gone he&#8217;ll turn me into a Comet; I just know he will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus&#8217;s face grew serious at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is danger of that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes, he would
be just about contemptible enough to do that very
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could he?&#8221; inquired Billy, his bewilderment
steadily increasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easiest thing in the world. He has only to set fire to
her hair, and it would stream out behind her in a fan of
flame. Then she&#8217;d be so frightened that she&#8217;d go wandering
off through space and become a Comet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I think we had better take Miss
Evening Star with us, don&#8217;t you? Unless her father, Mr.
Sun, can look after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus frowned at Billy impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that the Sun
never does any night work of any kind? Besides, just
now he&#8217;s busy on the other side of the world. Yes, we&#8217;ll
take her with us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>So Nimbus and the Evening Star and Billy went off
to the yard where the Meteors off duty and on part time
were assembled.</p>

<p>The inclosure, which was walled in by four fogs, was
full of them, jumping hurdles, playing marbles, or racing
around after each other.</p>

<p>So busy were they at their sport that it was not until
Nimbus had shouted himself hoarse that they paid the
slightest attention to him.</p>

<p>At last, however, one of them heard him and shot over
to see what he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;that you Meteors could
hear the rings of Saturn if they rang all at once. Did you
know that the Equator had escaped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, no!&#8221; said the Meteor, and instantly shot
about among his fellows spreading the dreadful news.</p>

<p>They left off playing immediately, and all lined up before
Nimbus for orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go find the Equator,&#8221; said the Fairy authoritatively.
&#8220;The Rays have gone to notify the Sun.
Ten of you will come with us. The other six million will
scatter about the universe and look for him. Let me know
the instant you see him, and stop him if he starts to come
back to the Earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the Meteors in a breath. With a great
crackling noise they shot away into the void, each taking
a different direction so that their going looked like a splendid
shower of rockets on the night of the Fourth of
July.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;With a great crackling noise they shot into the void&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;that the next thing to do
is to build a tower so we can see what is going on in the
sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have nothing to build it of,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could make it of Moonbeams if there were any
Moon,&#8221; replied Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Evening Star, &#8220;so we&#8217;d better
find a hill to climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a beautiful hill as we were coming here,&#8221; said
Billy. &#8220;It had a white top, and stood out ever so high over
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a volcano,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be just the
place for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be starting, then,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>So the whole party set out through the trees for the
volcano, and in an hour or two were standing on a great
lava field looking up at the dark sky, which seemed fairly
alive with fiery-tailed meteors hurrying here, there and
everywhere on their search for the Equator.</p>

<p>Billy had just settled himself with his back against a
comfortable boulder when he noticed right over his
head an object which resembled a great, luminous doughnut.
&#8220;I wonder what that is,&#8221; he said, pointing upward.</p>

<p>The Evening Star, quite exhausted with the tramp up
the mountain, had been sitting with her bright face in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hands. At Billy&#8217;s words she glanced up, and a terrified
scream brought Nimbus to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; shouted Nimbus excitedly. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming
this way, and we can never capture him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There who is?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Equator!&#8221; said Nimbus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>ON THE PASSIVE VOLCANO</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OF COURSE there was but one thing to do, and that
was to escape as quickly as possible. Even Nimbus,
powerful as he was, couldn&#8217;t control a runaway
Equator single-handed, and if the Evening Star were ever
turned into a comet it would take years of patient effort
on the part of her parents to turn her back into a Star
again.</p>

<p>Nimbus looked swiftly about him for a second, and then
he said: &#8220;Fortunately, this is not an active volcano, so we&#8217;ll
slip into the crater.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way toward a cavelike opening right in the
summit of the mountain&mdash;an opening which led downward
diagonally, so that it afforded ample shelter.</p>

<p>Billy hesitated. He had heard about volcanoes, and the
thought of bearding it in its crater was very terrifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; said Nimbus; &#8220;this is a passive
volcano.&#8221;</p>

<p>That reassured Billy, and when he was safe inside the
crater he asked what a passive volcano was.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one that isn&#8217;t active. There are two kinds of verbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and two kinds of volcanoes&mdash;active and passive. The
fire in this one has been banked, so it&#8217;s perfectly
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was still a little uneasy, and he was by no means
cheered by a sound of dull rumbling that came up out of
the depths of the crater.</p>

<p>He had little time to worry about this new danger, however,
for just then the crater became filled with terrific
heat, and its dark recesses were illumined by a brilliant
glare.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s eyes were dazzled at first, then right above him
he made out the circular form of the Equator staring
blankly down at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am lost!&#8221; cried the Evening Star, and with a
series of leaps she disappeared down the crater.</p>

<p>&#8220;The goose, she&#8217;ll be burned to death!&#8221; said Nimbus, and
started after her.</p>

<p>There was a sound of falling gravel, a sharp patter of
footsteps, and then silence.</p>

<p>Billy knew that it would be foolish to follow, so he
quietly waited for something to happen.</p>

<p>The Equator, meanwhile, was getting a little more accustomed
to the darkness. As he peered about he muttered
to himself, and Billy caught the words: &#8220;I hope she hasn&#8217;t
got away. There&#8217;s no one left but the Equine Ox, and
you couldn&#8217;t turn him into a Comet any more than you
could turn him out of a pasture.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;You ought not to turn anybody into a Comet,&#8221; said
Billy. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t polite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Equator started violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded, scowling at Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Billy,&#8221; said the little boy, &#8220;and I am a
friend of the Evening Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you could be turned into a Comet, Billy?&#8221;
asked the Equator solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I-I hope not,&#8221; faltered Billy. &#8220;I never tried,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; grumbled the Equator.
&#8220;Perhaps you can tell me where I can find the Evening
Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Billy decidedly. &#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, don&#8217;t be rude. I won&#8217;t turn her into a
very big Comet, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I shall not tell you where she
is, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was driven to it,&#8221; said the Equator; &#8220;when the Geographers
made me, they wanted to be sure to have enough
of me to go around, and I&#8217;ve been going around ever since.
It got so monotonous after a while that I simply had to
get into mischief or explode.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that why you escaped?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the Equine Ox went to sleep and I broke a
meridian and got away. It was quite oxidental, my escaping;
I mean accidental.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&#8220;It cannot be very nice, being an Equator,&#8221; said Billy
thoughtfully; &#8220;but it would be far worse to be a Comet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; said the Equator. &#8220;Comets only
have to get to a certain place once in two or three hundred
years, while an Equator has to be in one place always. I&#8217;m
very tired,&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;What do you usually do
when you&#8217;re tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sleep,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said the Equator; &#8220;how interesting. How
is it done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Billy eagerly, &#8220;you lie down somewhere,
then you close your eyes, then you think of sheep
jumping through a fence and try to count them until you
fall asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t think of any sheep jumping through a
fence. I never saw a sheep, nor a fence. Do you suppose
it would do just as well to count hippopotamuses jumping
through a swamp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Billy doubtfully, &#8220;although I never
tried it.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his great joy the Equator settled down on the summit
of the volcano and closed his eyes. He breathed hard
and regularly for a little, and then, as one eye opened, he
said: &#8220;What do you do when the third and seventh and
eleventh hippopotamus is a rhinoceros? Count him, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Billy, and again the Equator closed
his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Presently he opened them again. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve counted all the hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses
there are. Now what do I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begin on the camels and lions and tigers,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when they&#8217;re counted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count the ants,&#8221; said Billy with a sudden inspiration,
and the Equator troubled him no more.</p>

<p>Billy was delighted. The Equator&#8217;s lips moved rapidly
for some minutes, and Billy slipped quietly down into the
crater to find Nimbus and the Evening Star to tell them
to hurry and make their escape.</p>

<p>He wandered about blindly for some little time, then
stopped bewildered.</p>

<p>The crater forked in many directions. It seemed hopeless
to explore any one of them because his friends might
have taken another.</p>

<p>At last he determined to make sure that when they did
come back they would have no trouble in escaping.</p>

<p>Returning to the mouth of the crater he saw the Equator
still fast asleep.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s hands went to his pockets, and when they came
out they brought a quantity of fish-line, which he always
carried for emergencies.</p>

<p>He deftly tied the line to a huge stone, making sure
that the knot Was fast, and then very cautiously slipped
it through the center of the Equator, making a loose knot,
but one that would be reasonably sure to hold him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
doubled and redoubled the string, and when the job was
done stood back and surveyed it with considerable pride.</p>

<p>Then, assured that the Equator was at his mercy, he
began to hope for him to wake up so that he could enjoy
his triumph. He even coughed once or twice in the hope
of awakening his captive, but the Equator was very tired
and it seemed impossible to arouse him.</p>

<p>At last, unable longer to restrain his impulse, Billy took
a sharp stick and poked the Equator smartly once, twice,
three times.</p>

<p>The sleeper&#8217;s eyes opened, and he tried to yawn and
stretch, but the fish-line restrained him. He looked about
wrathfully and espied Billy.</p>

<p>Instantly his dull glowing skin became white hot with
rage, and the line melted away like straw.</p>

<p>The Equator sprang to his feet, his whole circular body
shining like the iron which the blacksmith has just taken
from the forge.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall pay for this, young man!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I may
not be able to turn you into a Comet, but I can maroon you
on the Polar Star, which will be quite as satisfactory.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Billy stood petrified with fear the Equator swept
down upon him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>JACK FROST</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IF YOU&#8217;VE never had an Equator sweep down on
you, of course you cannot understand in the least how
frightened Billy was. Even the Equine Ox grew gray
with fear when the Equator was angry, and the Equine
Ox was seldom disturbed by anything but indigestion in his
four stomachs.</p>

<p>As for Billy, he had never been really frightened before,
excepting the time he fell into a tar barrel, and looking
back upon it, that experience now seemed a very tame
affair.</p>

<p>He shrank back and waited for the worst. To his surprise
it did not happen. For just as the Equator was rushing
toward him, just as he was trying to say Jack Robinson,
and say it so quickly that his life would be spared an
instant or two before he was turned to ashes, he heard a
voice say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, &#8217;Quate! Loose, I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the Equator, who had been white-hot, turned
a sort of sickly yellow, then faded to dull red, and finally
to a bluish green. In the meantime he had stopped sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
down on Billy and was motionless, save for a tremor
that ran through his circular frame.</p>

<p>Between Billy and the Equator stood a wiry little fellow
dressed all in fluffy white, with a white cap to match. In
his hand he held what seemed to be a very straight icicle,
which glittered with all the hues of the rainbow.</p>

<p>The Equator glowered upon the newcomer for some
seconds before he growled huskily: &#8220;Jack Frost!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly correct,&#8221; said the stranger cheerfully. &#8220;I
always did admire a good memory for names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; demanded the Equator
sulkily, and Billy saw to his joy that he was now in no further
danger of attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that I am ashamed of,&#8221; returned Jack Frost,
&#8220;which is more, it seems to me, than you can say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Equator stared at Billy. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; he faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he doing?&#8221; asked Jack Frost, turning suddenly
to Billy. Before the little boy could answer the
Equator with a flop or two rose in the air, circled once or
twice over the trees and sailed rapidly away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad lot!&#8221; commented Jack Frost. &#8220;Never take him
seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he was going to burn me up,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;That&#8217;s different. Let&#8217;s go
and see about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought he had seen all of the Equator he cared
to, but Jack Frost insisted on watching that ill-tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
creature, and so Billy followed him to the very top of the
volcano where they could get a clear view of the horizon.</p>

<p>They saw the Equator making off a mile or two away,
and Jack Frost, taking Billy by the arm, started down the
mountain at a brisk trot. As they hurried along Jack
Frost said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have heard of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I have, many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so cold as I&#8217;m painted,&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you are not,&#8221; replied Billy respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;I really am not a bad fellow.
Your father probably holds it against me because I freeze
the water pipes sometimes, but think how the plumber&#8217;s
poor little children love me for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; continued Jack Frost, &#8220;I pinch little boys&#8217;
fingers, but that is only to remind them that they forget to
ask their mothers if they can go skating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only did that once,&#8221; said Billy, reddening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;I nip flowers. I do that
to warn them to go back into the ground, because winter
is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to do it,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I hope they don&#8217;t
object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do, though. People often object to things that
are good for them, like going to bed early, and washing
their hands and geography.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I love geography now,&#8221; protested Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m delighted to hear it. Do you like songs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. The Equine Ox knows a beautiful one
about the Equator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot imagine a beautiful song about the Equator,&#8221;
said Jack Frost. &#8220;See what you think of mine.&#8221; And seating
himself on the edge of the cliff they had been skirting,
with his heels hanging over space, he sang:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is a very pretty song,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jack Frost; &#8220;but what has become of
the Equator in the meantime?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked in every direction, but no sign of the Equator
was to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was listening to your song,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I forgot to
keep looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a very nice little boy,&#8221; said Jack Frost, patting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Billy on the head, &#8220;but we have just got to find that
Equator. There is no telling what he may be doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what he will try to do,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch Miss Evening Star and make a Comet out of
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great goodness! Why didn&#8217;t you say that before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t time,&#8221; explained Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always time,&#8221; said Jack Frost coldly. &#8220;Time
is everywhere. The supply is inexhaustible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Jack Frost kindly. &#8220;I dare say it
will turn out all right, like the farmer&#8217;s wagon that met the
automobile. Anyway, here comes the Geography Fairy.
He ought to have some tidings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking over the edge of the cliff, Billy saw Nimbus approaching.
He explained afterward that the crater which
he and the Evening Star had followed, led right through
the volcano and out of the cliff at the bottom.</p>

<p>Jack Frost hailed him, and Nimbus climbed up, bidding
his train of Meteors wait until he returned.</p>

<p>He and Jack Frost shook hands cordially, and Nimbus
inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have either of you seen anything of the Evening Star?
I lost track of her when we got out of the crater.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious!&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I thought she was with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;So she was,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;but she said she thought
she&#8217;d like to fly once more, and sailed off to pay the Moon
a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Frost looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where the Equator&#8217;s gone, then,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the Equator left the top of the volcano?&#8221; asked
Nimbus excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;He was just about to
destroy this little boy when I stopped him. He&#8217;s afraid
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than of any one else in the whole world,&#8221; said
Nimbus. &#8220;But where do you suppose he is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose,&#8221; said Jack Frost; &#8220;I can only suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he&#8217;s trailing the Evening Star, and if he finds
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he must not find her,&#8221; cried Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;he must not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the darkness above them shone a bright speck
that grew larger and larger. As it drew nearer Billy saw
that it was a Meteor, a new Meteor which he had never seen
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there!&#8221; shouted Nimbus, who had seen him the
same moment Billy did; &#8220;any message for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; puffed the Meteor, who was not within easy talking
distance. &#8220;Miss Evening Star is being chased by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Equator, and has only got about a thousand miles&#8217;
start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way are they going?&#8221; asked Nimbus and Jack
Frost in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; said the Meteor, &#8220;I forgot to ask.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE COMPASS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;STRANGE that you fellows never forget to ask for
your meals,&#8221; said Jack Frost tartly. &#8220;Your memory
never fails you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us not waste time scolding them,&#8221; said Nimbus.
&#8220;The important thing is to find where the Equator and
the Evening Star have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;We&#8217;ll establish headquarters
immediately, and send out scouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led the way to a little clump of palms which
was at the foot of a hill just below them.</p>

<p>The Meteors, like a great flock of fireflies, followed
along in their wake, and when they stopped they lined up
for orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nimbus, addressing them, &#8220;how many
points of the compass are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends entirely on the compass,&#8221; said one of the
Meteors.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;A large compass would
have more points than a small one. There&#8217;s more room
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;I can box the compass,&#8221; chirruped another Meteor
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can box ears,&#8221; snapped Nimbus peevishly.</p>

<p>Here Jack Frost broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell off a thousand Meteors,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to count all the
points on the largest compass, and then order a scout to
go in the direction pointed by each point. That ought to
get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; declared Nimbus. &#8220;Go to work, you fellows,
and carry out orders. The first one who discovers them,
notify Aurora Borealis, and she&#8217;ll flash the signal down
to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Meteors, who were always active when there was
work to be done, shot forth on their errands.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you suppose it will be before the Equator
can catch the Evening Star?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends on whether or not they are both going
in the same direction,&#8221; replied Jack Frost.</p>

<p>Billy smiled. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if they were going
in opposite directions he never would catch her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;Supposing I started for
the South Pole and you started for the North Pole, and
we both kept on going in the same direction after we got
there, what would happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought a minute. &#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;we&#8217;d
meet on the opposite side of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;if we didn&#8217;t stop on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the way. The Equator has probably gone in the opposite
direction, intending to meet the Evening Star on the other
side of the world. That would surprise her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;Jack Frost and I had
better start off in opposite directions and see which gets
to the other side of the world first. The one who does can
put a stop to this chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t know just which part of the other side
they&#8217;re going to meet on,&#8221; objected Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can take a chance,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
the Meteors will have to do, and we can beat them, because
we have no tails to drag after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can stay here and get him if he happens to pass,&#8221;
said Nimbus.</p>

<p>Billy was a little troubled about this, but he was not the
boy to admit that he was frightened, and, though his mouth
trembled a trifle and he winked a little more rapidly than
usual, he kept a brave face as his two friends each called
a cloud out of the sky and sailed away upon it.</p>

<p>He had stood there but a few minutes when he heard
the tinkling of a bell a little distance away. At first it
rang slowly and at long intervals, then faster and faster,
till at length it sounded like the triangle the man played in
one corner of the orchestra in the theater at home.</p>

<p>Thinking there could be no harm in finding out where
the sound came from, as the Equator was as little likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to alight in one place as another, he listened very carefully,
then proceeded slowly toward the tinkling sound.</p>

<p>Soon he came out into the very clearing where the trolley
car had reached the earth, and there stood the trolley car
with the face of the Equine Ox protruding from the front
door and wearing a very unhappy expression.</p>

<p>Confronting the Equine Ox was the conductor, who was
waving his hands and shouting, while the motorman was
stooping over, a little way off, gathering up a smooth round
stone about the size of an egg.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tinkle of the bell sounded continuously,
and the Equine Ox wriggled and writhed as if very much
displeased with his imprisonment.</p>

<p>The motorman being nearest to him, Billy addressed
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that stone?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw it at the Ox,&#8221; replied the motorman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; pleaded Billy. &#8220;You might hurt
him. And he isn&#8217;t doing anything bad, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; shouted the motorman. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t he
lashing his tail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; asked Billy. &#8220;All animals lash their
tails except bears and saddle horses and fox-hunters, which
haven&#8217;t any tails to lash.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Confronting the Equine Ox was the conductor, waving his hand and shouting&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his tail is caught in the bell rope,&#8221; said the motorman,
hurling the stone at the Equine Ox. The stone broke
a window, and although it did not reach its target, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
annoyed the creature so that he struggled more frantically
than before, and the bell jingled furiously.</p>




<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; cried the conductor excitedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting too
expensive for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Expensive!&#8221; said Billy in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, expensive. Every time he wiggles his tail
that way he rings up a fare, and he&#8217;s rung up more
than thirty-seven dollars&#8217; worth already. I&#8217;ve counted
&#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy understood why the motorman and the conductor
were so worried. The tail of the Ox had become entangled
in the rope that led to the fare register, and every tinkle
of the bell meant a fare recorded.</p>

<p>At first he was shocked to think of this wasteful extravagance,
but then he recollected that as the car was not on a
regular run the fares couldn&#8217;t really be counted against the
motorman and the conductor.</p>

<p>They were not at all certain of this when he explained
it to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going back, ain&#8217;t we?&#8221; asked the conductor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when we run the car into the barn they&#8217;ll charge
me with these fares,&#8221; said the conductor. &#8220;The car will
have been away so long that they&#8217;ll be disgusted if it has
not earned any money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;when Nimbus comes back I&#8217;ll
get him to enchant the register so it will only charge up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fares you have really collected. That will make it all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>This appeased the motorman and the conductor, and
in answer to Billy&#8217;s questions they explained how the
Equine Ox got into the car.</p>

<p>When they were left alone with him he had behaved very
badly, rolling on the ground and laughing very heartily,
which proved, as they had been told by Nimbus, that he
was furiously angry.</p>

<p>Then he began to sing, and at last he actually started
to run away.</p>

<p>But they prevented this by tying the trolley rope
tightly to his horn and securing him to the car, and
then, fearing that the rope might break, they hit upon a
stratagem.</p>

<p>They talked eagerly about the comforts and coolness
of the inside of the car, until the curiosity of the Equine
Ox outran his discretion and he insisted upon going in.</p>

<p>Knowing that he was governed by contraries, they tried
to prevent his doing so. This, as they expected, made him
all the more determined, and he forced his way past them
into the car.</p>

<p>But once inside he found it impossible to get out, and
then it was that he began the lashing of his tail, which had
resulted in the ringing up of so many fares.</p>

<p>Billy agreed with the motorman and the conductor that
the best place for the Equine Ox was in the trolley car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for if he tried too hard to escape they had only to shut
the door to keep him there.</p>

<p>So Billy sat down and told the trolley men everything
that had happened since he left them, and they became as
excited as he was about the chances of the Evening Star&#8217;s
escape from the Equator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had the Equator in reach of my crank handle,&#8221;
said the motorman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;that the Evening Star would come
past here right now. We&#8217;d get Nimbus to enchant the
trolley car again, and away we&#8217;d go back home with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the conductor. &#8220;We could use her for a
headlight on the way home.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all busily discussing what could be done to
secure the Evening Star against the Equator when they
had her in Billy&#8217;s home when a light shone above the trees
and soon a Meteor dropped among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just met the Equator going west-nor&#8217;west,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Nimbus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; bellowed the Equine Ox, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go sou&#8217;-sou&#8217;east,&#8221;
and he walked calmly away in that direction,
tearing out the forward end of the trolley car as he went.</p>

<small>THE TRAIL OF THE RUNAWAY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WITH wild cries the conductor and the motorman
ran after the Equine Ox, but although he appeared
to be walking, he went at a tremendous
speed, and soon they were compelled to give up the
chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; wailed Billy, who was terribly distressed at
the escape of the Equine Ox, &#8220;I wish there was something
I could do. But I am so small that I am absolutely useless
around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a cracking of branches close at hand, and to
Billy&#8217;s astonishment and delight the Equine Ox reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it is unlucky to be small, Billy?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>The motorman and the conductor started forward, but
the Equine Ox lowered his horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; he said to them. &#8220;I will give
you due notice of my next movements, and on the whole
I don&#8217;t think I will go at all. I don&#8217;t think the Equator
will come this way, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The conductor and the motorman still advanced, but
Billy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the Equine Ox is speaking the truth. His eyes
look honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My eyes are honest,&#8221; said the Equine Ox. &#8220;They
never deceived me in my life. But as I was saying, why
are you so sorry that you&#8217;re small?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I can&#8217;t be of any help when
things happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said the Equine Ox, and throwing back his
head he sang:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to be sorry any more,&#8221; said Billy, when the
song was finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the Equine Ox; &#8220;and now, if the
gentlemen don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to go back into the trolley
car. It fitted me perfectly, and it was such fun ringing
that bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trolley car&#8217;s broke,&#8221; said the conductor. &#8220;And if
it wasn&#8217;t I wouldn&#8217;t take a chance on having you ring up
any more fares.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Equine Ox, &#8220;then we might as
well sit quietly and await the reports of the Meteors.
They&#8217;ll be coming in very soon now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not a Meteor who first arrived. It was Jack
Frost and Nimbus, coming in from opposite directions
almost at the same time. Both had been clear around the
world, they said, and neither had seen a sign of the Equator
or the Evening Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Billy, when this dismal report was
received, &#8220;that we ought to notify the Sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t notify him,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;He and I are
utter strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent the Rays to notify him,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t think it will do any good. He can only travel so
fast anyway, not more than a million miles a minute, and
that would not do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there to do, then?&#8221; inquired Billy disconsolately.</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth when a Meteor
came dashing in among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221; asked Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of it,&#8221; said the Meteor. &#8220;News is happening
every minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means any news of the Evening Star or the
Equator,&#8221; said Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Meteor. &#8220;In fact I had forgotten all
about them in the excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;What excitement?&#8221; demanded Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the Meteor, &#8220;the most astonishing things
are happening. In Chicago grapefruits are growing on
Wabash Avenue, monkeys are swarming up the Tribune
Building on Madison Street, and they are raising tobacco
and watermelons on Drexel Boulevard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;and this is the middle of
January! What can that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great news,&#8221; sang out a voice overhead, and another
Meteor settled in among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snow has all melted in Duluth,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there is
an unprecedented sale of palmleaf fans all through that
part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before any one could express surprise at this astonishing
information a third Meteor and a fourth alighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ninety degrees in the shade in Winnipeg,&#8221; said
the third Meteor, &#8220;and they are picking cocoanuts in Quebec.
The baseball season has opened in Iceland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hotter still in Norway,&#8221; said the fourth Meteor, who
had just arrived; &#8220;oldest inhabitant never remembers such
sultry weather. Eskimos are now wearing mosquito nets
instead of furs, and they&#8217;re catching crocodiles in the Arctic
Ocean. The icebergs have begun to boil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do!&#8221; cried Jack Frost excitedly. &#8220;All the
work that I&#8217;ve been at for centuries is being undone. I&#8217;ll
soon have to organize a syndicate to attend to my business
if this keeps up. Whatever can have happened?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Another Meteor came in just then with still more
tidings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great schools of whales are passing Cape Nome,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;all going north. They&#8217;re picking strawberries off
the tundras there, and they are advertising hot springs for
rheumatism in a glacier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus, who had been sitting with knitted brows, suddenly
leaped to his feet, and slapped the conductor on the
back with such violence that that gentleman fell forward
against the Equine Ox.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what it is,&#8221; shouted Nimbus. &#8220;The Equator is
up there. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s making all this trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then far be it from me to stay here,&#8221; said Jack Frost,
preparing to start at once. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to have all my
good icebergs and glaciers melted like ice cream. It took
me countless centuries to make some of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind your old icebergs and glaciers,&#8221; said
Nimbus. &#8220;The point is that we&#8217;ve located the Equator
and we can stop him before he catches the Evening Star.
He can only thaw a radius of a few miles at one time, now
that he&#8217;s shrunk so, so you don&#8217;t need to worry at all about
his undoing your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, we must go up there,&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly must,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;and as soon as possible.
I expect Aurora Borealis will be reporting him at
any time now.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that exact moment the sky lighted up with pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
splendor that waved and flickered and danced over the
heavens.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is now,&#8221; cried Nimbus. &#8220;Come, let us be
off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Billy, who was intensely excited, &#8220;may I
go, too? I should dearly love to help catch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I guess so,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;I&#8217;ll enchant the
trolley car again and we&#8217;ll all go in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trolley car had been very badly damaged by the
Equine Ox, but Nimbus merely tapped it with his wand
and it became whole again. The motorman regarded him
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he be a wonder in a repair shop?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;ll hold together now,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Come
on, Jack Frost; come on, Billy,&#8221; and he led the way into
the car.</p>

<p>The conductor and the motorman took their places, and
the Equine Ox at the last moment crowded into the rear
door. There was scarcely room for him, but Nimbus did
not care to lose any time in putting him out.</p>

<p>The car was speedily got under way and soon was merrily
sailing along in the direction of the North Pole.</p>

<small>WHERE NIGHT IS SIX MONTHS LONG</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;IT IS a good thing that both the Evening Star and
the Equator shine,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;We can find them
so easily in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t going to be any dark,&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but there will be at night!&#8221; said Billy confidently.
&#8220;It is always dark at night. It has to be or you wouldn&#8217;t
know it was night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there won&#8217;t be any night for six months where we
are going,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;There never is at the North
Pole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious!&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;that must be dreadful. And
do the days last for six months, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure they do. If you ask a boy to come to your
house to spend the afternoon at the North Pole he stays
for three months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be terrible when the baby has the colic
all night,&#8221; said Billy thoughtfully. &#8220;That happens
often at our house, and Papa has to walk the floor with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about babies,&#8221; said Jack Frost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
&#8220;but I suppose they would stop crying before morning.
Maybe they&#8217;d be satisfied crying for a month or two if they
weren&#8217;t interrupted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an iceberg,&#8221; said Nimbus, who had been
keeping a lookout. &#8220;We ought to be getting there in
a little while now. We are running into a dawn anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the southward Billy noticed a faint grayish streak
in the sky, and soon he could see the white caps that the
breakers always wear to keep their heads warm on windy
days.</p>

<p>They were going very fast. Little white specks that
seemed to be flying past beneath them he now saw were
icebergs, and by-and-by these began to appear in great
numbers, dotting the sea like schools of tiny islands in all
directions.</p>

<p>Although the light was growing brighter all the time, he
was still aware of a faint flickering glow to the northward,
and this his friends told him was Aurora Borealis flashing
the news that the Equator and the Evening Star were still
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish this thing would hurry,&#8221; said Nimbus impatiently.
&#8220;We are not going more than five hundred miles
an hour now. Mere dawdling, I call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawling,&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how long it will be before we catch up to
them,&#8221; said Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Depends on whether we are
going in their direction or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack Frost gave a roar of rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Just look there. It took me
centuries to make that glacier, and now look at it. Isn&#8217;t
that a shame?&#8221;</p>

<p>Below them, where a range of snowy mountains skirted
the sea, they saw a long dark streak which, when more
closely observed, proved to be a mountain area entirely
bared of snow and leading like a great broad road to the
north.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what that wretched Equator has been doing,&#8221;
said Jack Frost sadly. &#8220;He&#8217;s spoiled a glacier that was a
work of art&mdash;almost my masterpiece. I suppose when I
get up to the North Pole I&#8217;ll find he has melted that. And
if he has, it&#8217;ll spoil. You cannot possibly keep a North
Pole unless you keep it on ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cried Nimbus, who plainly did not share
Jack Frost&#8217;s annoyance, &#8220;we can trace him now.
That is where he must have lighted. Let&#8217;s go down
there and see if we can find any trace of the Evening
Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when the car began rapidly to
descend, and presently it was resting on a mountain top
between two tall ice cliffs.</p>

<p>Jack Frost looked at them ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my glacier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My beautiful glacier&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the best I ever built. And now look at it. Ruined,
utterly ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nimbus, who had been searching over the rocks, uttered
a cry of pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Equator got here first. The
Evening Star did not come till later. So she is probably
safe, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;When he got here and cleaned
the snow off&#8221;&mdash;Jack Frost grunted disgustedly&mdash;&#8220;the
flowers began to spring up. Here are daisies and buttercups
and forget-me-nots and violets and trilliums, all growing
where he turned the heat on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that proves anything,&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;whether you see it or not.
After they grew and blossomed somebody came and picked
lots of them. You can see where they have been snipped
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been the Evening Star,&#8221; continued Nimbus.
&#8220;She&#8217;s very fond of flowers, you know, and nobody
else could get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Jack Frost; &#8220;there may be something in
that. But whether there is or not, I must rebuild this
glacier, or at least start it. I&#8217;ll begin by cutting down these
flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;They look so pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
here among the snowdrifts. Let them just stay for a while
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;for a while, if it will please
you. But I want you to understand that they are in the
way of the loveliest glacier that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind your glacier,&#8221; shouted Nimbus. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
found the track of the Evening Star, and she is going east
instead of north.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had climbed up a crevice in one of the ice cliffs and
was studying the surface of a thin covering of new-fallen
snow.</p>

<p>There before him were the dainty footprints of the
Evening Star, and here and there a blossom apparently
fallen from her bouquet lay scattered along the
tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nimbus, &#8220;we will separate. Billy, you and
I will go after the Evening Star, and you, Jack Frost, can
follow the open trail of the Equator and see if you can find
him. If you do find him, be sure not to let him get
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about us?&#8221; said the motorman severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had forgotten you!&#8221; said Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the motorman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better,&#8221; said the Equine Ox, sticking his
head out of one of the windows of the car. &#8220;Always remember
yourself last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to hear anything more from you,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
motorman. &#8220;It&#8217;s against the rules for a beast to talk, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that!&#8221; said a voice from a little
peak just above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear,&#8221; said Billy, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said the voice, as a great white Polar Bear
threaded his way down the slope toward the trolley
car.</p>

<p>But the motorman and the conductor seemed to think
there were many reasons why not. They hastily sought
shelter inside the car and closed the door after them, while
the Equine Ox, with a snort of terror, pulled his head in so
quickly that he brought away a part of the sash with his
horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that bear will get them
or us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to eat the side of the trolley car before he
gets them,&#8221; said Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by that time,&#8221; added Jack Frost, &#8220;he&#8217;ll be so full
he won&#8217;t have any more room for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, leaving the bear busily gnawing at the sash board of
the car, Nimbus, Jack Frost and Billy proceeded afoot on
their quest.</p>

<p>Jack Frost set out on the Equator&#8217;s trail at a prodigious
pace, muttering to himself at each fresh discovery of a
ruined glacier or melted icefield.</p>

<p>Billy and Nimbus proceeded more slowly, for the track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the Evening Star was not always distinct, and it was
plain that, here and there, when the going was hard, she
had sailed over the obstructing cliffs.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the track disappeared altogether,
nor could they find it, search as they might.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose she has gone?&#8221; inquired Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up,&#8221; said Nimbus briefly. &#8220;Probably saw the Equator
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he was speaking they heard a familiar voice, and Jack
Frost hailed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Nimbus; &#8220;what are you doing over here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where the track brought me,&#8221; replied Jack
Frost, and Billy and Nimbus saw that the trail through the
snow which had been melted by the Equator was within a
few yards of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That explains why the Evening Star stopped walking,&#8221;
said Nimbus. &#8220;She saw the Equator headed
over this way, and decided she had better travel a little
faster.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had grown quite light, so that the flashes of Aurora
could no longer seem to guide them, for they had quite
faded in the brighter dawn.</p>

<p>As Billy was very tired, Jack Frost and Nimbus
agreed to sit down for a few minutes while he rested.
In the mean time they sent a Meteor back for the trolley
car so that they might continue their journey more
easily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;Walking is foolish, anyway,&#8221; said Jack Frost. &#8220;Why
any one who can fly should ever walk is a mystery to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Birds do,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;and sometimes they overdo it,
like the awkward auk. Did you ever hear about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;I never did, but I should love to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sad story,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;but here it is&#8221;:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Two excellent wings had the awkward auk,</div>
<div class="indent">But he was never known to fly,</div>
<div class="verse">Preferring a rambling, shambling walk,</div>
<div class="indent">And the walruses wondered why;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet there seems no reason that on this point</div>
<div class="indent">Their minds should have been so hazy,</div>
<div class="verse">For it&#8217;s clear to me as a thing can be</div>
<div class="indent">That the awkward auk was lazy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Though he might have skirted the rainbow&#8217;s rim</div>
<div class="indent">Or circled above the seas,</div>
<div class="verse">The only gait that appealed to him</div>
<div class="indent">Was one of reposeful ease;</div>
<div class="verse">He strutted about o&#8217;er the crags and cliffs</div>
<div class="indent">In a most ungainly fashion,</div>
<div class="verse">And the fowls that flew he was prone to view</div>
<div class="indent">With a kind of cold compassion.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;But it chanced one night that a hungry fox</div>
<div class="indent">Got a look at the awkward auk,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was strolling about on the spray-washed rocks</div>
<div class="indent">With his usual clumsy walk;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<div class="verse">He made a dash for the startled bird,</div>
<div class="indent">And the auk with a frown of fright</div>
<div class="verse">On his furrowed brow, observed that now</div>
<div class="indent">Was a crisis that called for flight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;He flapped and flopped with his feeble wings,</div>
<div class="indent">And he wobbled his trifling tail;</div>
<div class="verse">But, alas! The long-neglected things</div>
<div class="indent">Were not of the least avail;</div>
<div class="verse">Which is why the fox, as he licked his chops</div>
<div class="indent">With a gratified gusto, winked,</div>
<div class="verse">And is why the auk who preferred to walk</div>
<div class="indent">Has come to be quite extinct.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Jack Frost had just finished the last word when the
Meteor came flying up to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Equator,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is at the North Pole, and the
Evening Star is hiding under a glacier there. As soon
as he melts the glacier&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything will be lost,&#8221; finished Nimbus. &#8220;Come on,
there is not a moment to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there in a minute,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
got to start those melted glaciers first; you know that&#8217;s
my job, and I dare not neglect it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Nimbus. &#8220;Billy and I will go on without
you. Come on, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy started to follow him, but Nimbus, in his excitement,
had completely forgotten the little boy. He struck
up a pace that Billy could not possibly keep, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was out of hearing&mdash;a tiny speck on the vast white snowfield
that stretched ahead toward the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to go with you, Jack Frost,&#8221; said
Billy, turning sadly toward the spot where that worthy
had been standing.</p>

<p>But Jack Frost had vanished utterly, and there was
Billy deserted on a great Arctic snowfield, just at the most
exciting moment of the chase.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE END OF THE CHASE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT MUST be admitted that there were tears in the little
boy&#8217;s eyes, tears that overflowed and made damp,
messy places on his wide shirt-collar before they could
be ordered back where they belonged.</p>

<p>They were tears of disappointment rather than fear,
although certain thoughts of bears and walruses and even
great sharp-billed Arctic owls insisted on following one
another very rapidly through his mind.</p>

<p>But when five minutes passed and no bears nor other
terrifying creatures appeared Billy began to take heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re sure to miss me,&#8221; he said aloud, for it was comforting
to hear a sound, even if it were only that of his own
voice. &#8220;And when they do miss me they&#8217;ll find me. They
are fairies, and they can find anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything but the Evening Star,&#8221; said a deep voice beside
him. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t found her yet, remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy jumped almost out of his shoes, he was so startled,
but he looked bravely in the direction of the voice just the
same, and to his amazement he saw the Equine Ox standing
knee deep in snow and switching his tail vigorously as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
had learned to switch it in the tropics where the flies are
bad. It made Billy laugh to see him do it in the Arctic
Circle. But the Equine Ox said it was a warming process.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said the Equine Ox, &#8220;that they haven&#8217;t found
the Evening Star. That is chiefly because they refused to
ask me to help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;you are supposed to be back there
with the conductor and the motorman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not interesting,&#8221; said the Equine Ox. &#8220;No
doubt they are very worthy people, but they are not interesting.
They talked about pie and cheese sandwiches and
fried beefsteak and other things I do not care for, so I came
up here. I knew I would have to, anyway, before they
found the Evening Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world did you get here?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Equine Ox.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re here, so you must have got here,&#8221; insisted
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked,&#8221; said the Equine Ox placidly, &#8220;how in the
world I got here. I didn&#8217;t get here in the world. I got
here out of the world. I came by way of the Big
Dipper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;I suppose I see. Anyway, it would
not be polite to keep on asking you questions, even if I
don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An Equine Ox,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;can go anywhere he
pleases, on the world or off of it. I hadn&#8217;t seen the Big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Dipper for some time, so I went up there, took a drink and
came down here. I know of nothing easier to do than that,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy knew of a great many things that would have been
easier for him to do; so many, in fact, that it would be
too great a task to enumerate them, so he kept silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope you can help them find the Evening Star,&#8221; he
said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I can,&#8221; said the Equine Ox. &#8220;There she is
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; cried Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over across the lake on the other side of the mountain&#8221;&mdash;and
the Equine Ox pointed with his tail to the
southward. &#8220;Just now she is frozen in a glacier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;and there is no one to help us to
get her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless you count us,&#8221; said the conductor. &#8220;But I suppose,
of course, you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was standing right at Billy&#8217;s elbow, and directly
behind him was the motorman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Equine Ox ran away on us again,&#8221; explained the
conductor, noticing Billy&#8217;s astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ran away on you?&#8221; inquired Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means off of them,&#8221; said the Equine Ox. &#8220;He&#8217;s
dreadfully ungrammatical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call me names,&#8221; said the conductor threateningly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t quarrel,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;The Evening Star
is in that glacier over yonder, and we must get her out of
it or she&#8217;ll freeze to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s,&#8221; said the motorman.</p>

<p>Billy excitedly hurried to the glacier, and the others followed
as fast as they could.</p>

<p>It was plain that somebody was confined within
its green depths, for a form could be distinctly seen
by the whole party, who flattened their noses against
the cliff-like side of the glacier and gazed eagerly
into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better begin to batter in the ice with
your horns,&#8221; said the motorman, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll follow you up
and throw out the loose ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Equine Ox, thus addressed, fell energetically to
work and soon had broken a fair-sized hole in the ice
wall.</p>

<p>Into it dashed the conductor and the motorman, and they
threw out the fragments of ice broken off by the sharp
horns, while Billy, unable to do anything or to find any
place to work at all, stood and wrung his hands in impatience.</p>

<p>It was a hard task, but the three kept steadily at it, and
in a very little while only a thin wall separated them from
the object of their search.</p>

<p>Suddenly the last film of ice was broken through, and
then they all fell back in blank amazement, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was not the Evening Star at all who came forth,
but Jack Frost, looking rather chilly and very much
ashamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Frost!&#8221; cried the Equine Ox. &#8220;Jack Frost, by
all that&#8217;s astonishing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; said the conductor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me neither,&#8221; said the motorman, &#8220;and many of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world did you get in there, Jack Frost?&#8221;
asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hate to admit it,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;but I froze
myself in. It was all a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistakes will happen,&#8221; said the motorman. &#8220;The best
of us are sure to make &#8217;em at times. I hate to run over
dogs, but sometimes I do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;I was in a hurry to rebuild
that glacier, and I got so interested I didn&#8217;t leave myself
any place to get out till it was all done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you build it from the outside?&#8221; asked
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way men build things,&#8221; said Jack Frost.
&#8220;It&#8217;s different with us Nature people. Did you ever see
a tree built from the outside? Or a tomato?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy couldn&#8217;t remember that he ever had.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued Jack Frost, &#8220;I wish you would
tell me the news. Has the Equator got the Evening Star
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you been finding out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Jack Frost,&#8221; said the Equine Ox impatiently,
&#8220;that&#8217;s a nice question for you to be asking. If we
had been finding out, what would have become of
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, of course, you knew it was I who was in
here when you started digging?&#8221; said Jack Frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; roared the motorman. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the critter
on that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Equine Ox tossed his horns indifferently and
stalked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the place where the Equator ought to be,&#8221; said
the Equine Ox. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of this business. I wish I&#8217;d
never come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means that he wishes he&#8217;d never came,&#8221; said the
conductor to the motorman. &#8220;Somehow that sentiment
hits me&mdash;hits me hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hits me like a pile driver,&#8221; said the motorman. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go back with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, if you are coming,&#8221; said the Equine Ox, who
had overheard them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a lift as far as&mdash;where
do you live, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suburbia,&#8221; said the conductor.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the Equine Ox; &#8220;climb on my back
and we&#8217;ll be in Suburbia in time for supper. Jack Frost,
you can send Nimbus back with the car.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; cried Jack Frost after them, &#8220;as soon as we
find the Equator.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a little while Billy, standing beside Jack Frost,
watched them as they galloped off toward where the blue
of the sky met the white of the snowfields. The Equine
Ox seemed not to mind the load he carried, and just as
Billy turned away the conductor and the motorman were
lighting their pipes preparatory to settling down for a
comfortable ride. Then Jack Frost spoke to him and Billy
saw them no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that on the snow mountain over there?&#8221; Jack
Frost was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see,&#8221; said Billy, even before he turned
to look.</p>

<p>The snow mountain was only a little way off, and upon
its summit some dark object seemed to move as if fluttering
in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go ahead,&#8221; said Jack Frost, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll be with you
in a minute. I forgot to stop up that hole you fellows dug
in the glacier. If the Equator ever gets in there he&#8217;ll destroy
the whole thing again in a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;but don&#8217;t be long, for I may
need help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Frost turned back, and Billy set out alone for the
snow mountain, and soon got close enough to get a good
view.</p>

<p>At first he was overjoyed, for upon the mountain he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Evening Star, and he felt that the long quest for her
was as good as ended.</p>

<p>A few steps further, however, brought him to the brink
of a circular abyss, too wide to leap over and far too deep
to fall into. It shut him off completely from the peak that
rose in its center.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Frost will be able to make an ice bridge across it
when he comes,&#8221; said Billy, so he patiently sat down to
wait.</p>

<p>In another instant he cried out in alarm.</p>

<p>Overhead sounded a crackling and snapping, and swiftly
the Equator dropped down from a great height and began
to hover directly over the head of the Evening Star.</p>

<p>Already the ice under her had begun to melt. Soon it
would melt away altogether and then Billy knew that the
Equator, kept at a distance now by fear of the cold snow,
would fall upon her and bear her away, and perhaps turn
her into a Comet right before his horrified eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>ACROSS THE RAINBOW</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;OH, IF I could only get over there!&#8221; moaned Billy.
He had not stopped to think what he would do
if he were there. His eagerness to help the Evening
Star was so keen that he was almost ready to leap the
abyss before him. He even went to the brink and tried to
calculate his chances of getting across with a running
jump, but he saw that the best jumper in the world could
not have got half way over before he would have tumbled
into the icy depths below. So, with a sigh, he sat down
to think.</p>

<p>Billy did not mean to cry&mdash;he never meant to cry&mdash;but
the sight of the Equator hovering so closely over the Evening
Star and melting down the snow mountain like a wax
taper brought an unbidden tear or two to his eyes, and they
rolled slowly down his cheeks.</p>

<p>One of them fell on his stocking, where it quickly froze,
and Billy, looking at it disconsolately, observed that it
shone with the hues of the rainbow in the light thrown off
by the Equator.</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaped to his feet, dancing for joy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8220;The Rays!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;they will build me a bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he called them by name one after another:</p>

<p>&#8220;Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and
Red!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the little people stood before him, and Red,
who was their spokesman, asked him what he desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bridge!&#8221; cried Billy. &#8220;A bridge as quickly as you
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the work of a second. The little people all sprang
into the air together and lo! in front of Billy stretched a
slender rainbow bridge, leading from his feet to the snow
mountain on which was the imprisoned Evening Star.
And at each end was a great pot of yellow gold as large
as a preserve kettle.</p>

<p>Bravely Billy started to cross the bridge. It trembled
violently in the strong light, as rainbows will, for they are
flimsy things at best. Billy hesitated. He was not frightened,
but it was so hard to keep his balance.</p>

<p>And then he heard a cheery shout behind him, and up
came Jack Frost running as fast as his legs could carry
him, and fairly panting with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Billy, go ahead!&#8221; he called, laying a
steadying hand on the rainbow, which at once hardened
under his cold.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged Billy proceeded. As he went on he
noticed that the snow mountain had ceased to melt. Indeed,
it was beginning slowly to rise in the air again, thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to the influence of Jack Frost, who was freezing the water
far faster than the Equator could melt it.</p>

<p>Up, up it went, its peak narrowing to a needle point.
Above it the Equator, unused to the cold, shriveled and
shrank. Now he was the size of a hoop, now of a doughnut,
presently he was scarcely larger than a ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slide!&#8221; shouted a familiar voice behind Billy. &#8220;Slide,
Evening Star, slide for your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Evening Star heard the voice, and she, as well as
Billy, recognized it as the voice of Nimbus.</p>

<p>&#8220;The snow mountain is the North Pole!&#8221; cried Nimbus.
&#8220;I just asked an Eskimo where it was and he pointed it
out. I came just in time, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>The last question was addressed to the Evening Star,
who had followed his advice and slid right into his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I jumped the gully,&#8221; said Nimbus, pointing to the
abyss. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t time to come over the bridge. And
now I think we&#8217;ve got the Equator where we want him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you want me?&#8221; snarled the Equator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over this Pole,&#8221; said Nimbus, and as he spoke he slid
up the North Pole as a sailor slides down a rope, grasped
the Equator and impaled him upon it.</p>

<p>He rolled him down and down until Jack Frost could
reach him and help hold him, and the Equator, feeling himself
stretched like an elastic over the conical snow peak,
saw that he was doomed to be rolled back around the earth
and resume his post of duty in the center.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struggled and twisted in his efforts to escape, but
Nimbus held him fast, and Jack Frost kept him small by
the clutch of his icy fingers.</p>

<p>Billy danced up and down in his excitement, for once the
Equator almost got away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on down! Go on down!&#8221; shouted Billy. &#8220;My
mother says you are only an imaginary line, anyway!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Why, Billy,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;look at the way you
have eaten up your poor North Pole!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at the sound of his mother&#8217;s voice Nimbus put a
sunbeam into Billy&#8217;s mouth which tasted just like lemon
candy. The clang of the enchanted trolley car sounded in
his ears as the whole lot of his new friends stepped aboard
and vanished from his sight. He looked around. But, instead
of Nimbus and the Evening Star and Jack Frost
and the Equator, he found his mother smiling down at him
as he lay under the lilac bush, and the conductor was just
ringing the bell for the trolley car to stop at the corner.</p>
